# Data-Programming
It involves predicting whether the new is real or fake based using different models.

There are four models that are used here:

1. Logistic Regression
2. SVM
3. Naive Bayes Classifier
4. Neural Networks

The prediction is done on unseen data on neural networks.

For all models ROC,AUC,Cross Validation and Confusion Matrix has been plotted.
